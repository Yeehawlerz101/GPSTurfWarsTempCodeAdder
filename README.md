## FAQ
Q: What API am I using to retrive the data?

A: Prasehub, its nice and easy to use so yep.

Q: Why are you hosting this on github?

A: I belive in developers being transparent as possible so to keep to my word Im posting both the API source code and this web pages source incase anyone can/wants to learn from this and use this.

Q: Why did you make this?

A: I needed somthing to take my mind away from college exams and somthing that challenged me since I've never finished a project that required coding regularly.

Q: Whats your mob code?

A: "DEViANCE" without the quotes. I'm pretty small but hopefully with this will let new players mob up faster to catch up with some of the older players.

Q: Whats the background image youre using?

A: Go to the github page for this project look up "gangster_painting-2560x1600.jpg" you'll probably find it pretty quick and credits to whoever made it also as I dont own it and will never claim to.
