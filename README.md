## FAQ
Q: What API am I using to retrieve the data?

A: Prasehub, its nice and easy to use so yep.

Q: Why are you hosting this on GitHub?

A: I believe in developers being transparent as possible so to keep to my word I'm posting both the API source code and this web pages source in case anyone can/wants to learn from this and use this.

Q: Why did you make this?

A: I needed something to take my mind away from college exams and something that challenged me since I've never finished a project that required coding regularly.

Q: What's the background image you're using?

A: Go to the GitHub page for this project look up "gangster_painting-2560x1600.jpg" you'll probably find it pretty quick and credits to whoever made it also as I don't own it and will never claim to.
