<p>Q: Why shoud I (being you the visitor) donate?</p>
  <p>I dont want to sound like a sob story but, currently I'm going to a communitty college, then a university to get a degree in software reverse engineering.  I'm working part-time and living with may parents to help save on expenses. I spend a lot of my money on my old Buick Lesabre from '05 to afford gas and even going to work. By donating youll do a majority of 5, things.</p>
      <li>Help me afford college (tust me every anything helps).</li>
      <li>Allow me to accomplish my dreams</li>
      <li>Put hope in myself knowing that at least someone liked what I did</li>
      <li>It gives a goal to some of my projects</li>
      <li>I can sleep easier at night since I won't be so desperate for looking for another job.</li>

      <p>A: Prasehub, its nice and easy to use so yep.</p>
      <p><b>Q:</b> Why are you hosting this on github?</p>

      <p><b>Q:</b> Why did you make this?</p>
      <p>A: I needed somthing to take my mind away from college exams and somthing that challenged me since I've never finished a project that required coding regularly.</p>
      <p><b>Q:</b> Whats your mob code?</p>

      <p>A: Go to the github page for this project look up "gangster_painting-2560x1600.jpg" you'll probably find it pretty quick and credits to whoever made it also as I dont own it and will never claim to.</p>
